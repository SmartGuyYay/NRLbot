      "Bro, that's a take more cooked than a Canberra penalty in the finals.",
      "You sound like a Parra fan after they’ve lost a final.",
      "That’s more ridiculous than the Knights calling themselves premiership contenders.",
      "Is this a take or a cry for help? I need answers.",
      "I’d rather watch a Raiders fan explain how they almost won than hear that.",
      "That sounds like something you'd hear in a Roosters supporter’s delusional dream.",
      "I’ve seen better analysis from a kid playing SuperCoach in their lunch break.",
      "Bro, this is like the Storm's salary cap — it just doesn’t make sense.",
      "This roast hits harder than the Raiders' tackle technique.",
      "Your opinion’s more inconsistent than the NRL ref calls.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Broncos)
      "Even the Broncos would drop that take after a pre-season trial.",
      "That’s like a Broncos fan claiming they invented the sport. Please stop.",
      "You just dropped a bomb more explosive than a Broncos’ season collapse.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Tigers)
      "Your take is like the Tigers’ finals hopes — non-existent.",
      "This take is worse than the Tigers' defence after a weekend off.",
      "That’s more ridiculous than the Tigers calling themselves premiership contenders.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Raiders)
      "This take sounds like a Raiders fan after a loss. Stop lying to yourself.",
      "I’d rather listen to the NRL’s official highlights than that.",
      "You just compared your team to a premiership contender? C’mon, mate.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Manly)
      "You talk more rubbish than a Manly fan after a loss.",
      "I’d rather be stuck in a stadium with a Manly fan than hear that take again.",
      "That’s like a Manly fan trying to explain why they’re the best team in the NRL.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Warriors)
      "Bro, you talk like a Warriors fan who just won a game. Settle down.",
      "Bro, even the Warriors would reject that take for being too negative.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Knights)
      "Even the Knights wouldn't take that opinion seriously.",
      "That’s like calling the Rabbitohs the real winners of every grand final.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Cowboys)
      "That take is more cooked than a Cowboys' away game.",
      "That’s like picking the Cowboys to make the top 4 every year.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Parra)
      "Did a Parra fan write that or was it just their hopes?",
      "Bro, that’s colder than a Melbourne winter.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Gold Coast)
      "That take’s more hopeless than a Gold Coast season review.",
      "This is the kind of take that makes you a meme on the NRL subreddit.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Rabbitohs)
      "That’s like calling the Rabbitohs the real winners of every grand final.",
      "Bro, that take’s straight-up pain for every NRL fan in existence.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Bulldogs)
      "That take's got more flaws than the Bulldogs' attack in the past decade.",
      "Bro, that was less hot than a Bulldogs’ attack after round 5.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Sharks)
      "Bro, this take is more out of place than a Sharks’ premiership ring.",
      "That take's got less structure than the Tigers' attack.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Dolphins)
      "That take’s got less support than the Dolphins in 2023.",
      "You just compared your team to a premiership contender? C’mon, mate.",
      
      // Reactions related to specific teams (Storm)
      "Bro, this is like the Storm's salary cap — it just doesn’t make sense.",
